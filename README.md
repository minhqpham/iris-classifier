# iris-classifier
A classifier of the iris dataset neural network principles, specifically linear classification with non-linearity logistics and gradient descent. 

The dataset is analyzed and classified for the first time using the logistics, then MSE (mean-squared error) is calculated and optimized using gradient descent. The data is plotted accordingly using ggplot in R.

In terms of bulding the classfier, a multi-layer neural network is created using the keras machine learning toolbox, specifically TensorFlow, to classify the iris classes. See the writeup for more details.
